      <h4>C O N T E X T</h4>
      <p> Roomies is a case study that addresses the problems that occur when people live with roommates. It is a mobile app that attempts to organize and plan events ahead of time so that less arguments will occur. </p>
      <h3>  D E S I G N &nbsp; P R O C E S S</h3>
      <h4>D I S C O V E R</h4>
      <p> Through field study, interviews, and personal experiences, I've gathered the problems people commonly face when living with another person: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Unequally distributed amount of chores </li>
        <li> Grocery shopping </li>
        <li> Personal vs communal items</li>
        <li> Personal vs communal space </li>
        <li> Sound/ Noise </li>
        <li> Not turning off the lights / heater</li>
        <li> Paying rent </li>
        <li> Reminders </li>
      </ul>
        <h4>D E F I N E &nbsp; & &nbsp; D E V E L O P </h4>
        <p> I thought about the problems that people addressed, and attempted to find a solution. No one does chores because there is no incentive into doing them. Thus, I've incorporated a point system where the user, along with their roommates, can assign a point value to each chore. At the end of each month, the user with the most amount of points can be awarded something that is agreed upon beforehand with the other roommates (a record can be kept of who won for which month in the archives). </p>
        <p> While addressing timing/ event planning, I've incorporated a calendar so that the users can visualy see and warn others ahead of time. </p>
        <p>When asking for permission or asking for a group response, a basic poll can be utilized. The problem when it comes to communication can also be solved by displaying the user's availability. If the user is at home (through wifi connection), the app states that he/she is home; however, if the user presses on their icon on the right, their status changes to busy. When the user leaves the home, they are marked as "away". This can also help with noise complaints some roommates may have by marking themselves as "busy". </p>
        <p>Here are some of problems addresses/ notes taken:  </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">For this project, our group has decided to focus on the mobile version of LumiNUS. LumiNUS is the new NUS student portal that was officially implemented in the beginning of AY19/20. It was introduced as a replacement for the old student portal,
                IVLE and as such, many of IVLE’s old functions have been brought over to this new platform. LumiNUS aims to act as all NUS students's one stop portal for mainly downloading lecture and tutorial materials, submitting assignments as well
                as receiving announcements from lecturers. As the purpose of this case study was to provide a new user-friendly solution, we did not make a mid/high fidelity prototype due to the given time constraint.&nbsp;</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;font-weight: bold;">User Research</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">From our research, we have gathered that 73.0% of students use the application between 1-4 times a week. 86.6% of users use the app to check for updated announcements and information while 68.7% of users use it to download files and 32.8%
                of users use it to check their respective module forums. From this, we are able to find out what the primary uses of the application are and priorities these functions. It is important to ensure that the application fulfills its main purpose
                before trying to improve it by focusing on the UI or adding in new functions. If an application cannot carry out its basic functions, there will be no point in further optimizing the application.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">The next part of our research was aimed at understanding the existing problems with the application so that we could build on ways to improve it as well as draw specific pain points from these issues. We have decided to split our findings
                into problems users have with the UX and problems that users have with the UI.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">Starting with problems with the UX, 76.1% of users found that the application was difficult to navigate and 74.6% of them found that the tabs in the sidebar were not placed in an accessible manner. 71.6% of students found the layout confusing
                and unclear while 61.2% of them agreed that the login process was inconvenient.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">As for UI problems, 58.2% of the users felt that the layout of the home feed was unappealing while 56.7% of them found that this was due to clutter. 30.8% of users found the font and font size in the application unaesthetic and 26.7% of people
                wanted to see a change in the overall color scheme of the application.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">From the information that we have gathered above, we found that the common theme that constantly appeared in the problems with the UI and UX had to do with the poor navigation that the application currently provides. Issues such as poor layouts
                and cluttered home pages are direct causes of poor navigation and can therefore be blamed for the poor user experience thus far. As such, the pain point that our group will be focusing on would be the navigation in mainly the home page
                and the modules page. We have narrowed our focus down to these two pages in particular because from our primary user research, we have learned that students mainly use the application to download or submit module materials as well as get
                up to date on announcements. Therefore, we have decided to focus on the two pages where these functions can be primarily completed on.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">Figure 3 illustrates the current user flow within the module tab (Home Feed &gt; NM3221 &gt; NM3221 Announcement Page &gt; Sidebar (Lesson Flow) &gt; NM3221 Lesson Flow Page &gt; Sidebar (Announcement) &gt; NM3221 Announcement Page).</p>
            <p
                style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">One major issue that was pointed out by out user research is illustrated in the first screenshot. The list of tabs in the sidebar are cluttered, disorganised and the layout did not take into consideration the physical frame of an iPhone, causing
                the tab names to be placed on the far left of the screen, which caused it to be difficult to see. Furthermore, the app tried to fit in all the functions available on the web version of LumiNUS, however, this caused the app to be confusing
                as there are too many options on the screen.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">When users access the module, the first page they will see is the announcements page published by the lecturer of that specific module. In order for users to go to other functions in the module, users have to search through a list of function
                    in the sidebar. Hence as illustrated in figure 3, when a user chooses the tab ‘Lesson Flow’ the user will be brought to the module’s lesson flow page and in order for users to navigate back to the previous page, they will have to scroll
                    through the list of functions in the sidebar again to look for the page.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">There are two issues with the current flow. Firstly, because there is no title to indicate which page users are on in the app, it makes it difficult for users to identify the page they are currently on the app. Secondly, due to the lack
                    of a ‘back’ button on the app as well as IOS itself, it makes it difficult for users to navigate between previous pages.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">LumiNUS users need an efficient and convenient way to complete tasks on-the-go to adapt to the prominent multi-tasking culture adopted by young adults.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;font-weight: bold;">Proposed Design Solutions</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;font-weight: normal;">Hence, to address the problems as listed above, we propose to install a ‘back’ button to allow users to navigate between previous and current pages easily as well as adding titles at the top of the screen to allow users to be aware of their
                location within the app.</p>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row flex-box flex-wrap-wrap">
                    <div class="col-sm-4 col-lg-5 flex-box flex-justify-center flex-align-center"><img src="assets/img/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-27%20at%208.49.04%20PM.png" style="width: 50%;"><a class="fancybox" rel="gallery1" title="Hero Image Nature" href="assets/img/Web%201920%20–%205.png"></a></div>
                    <div class="col-lg-7">
                        <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 0px;">In the previous user flow, when the user first clicks on a module, they will be shown the module overview page. However, in our new proposed design, we have decided to use the announcement tab as the landing page instead. As this
                            is one of the top functions used by users, we have thus decided to make the announcement tab more accessible so that users do not have to spend more time clicking in order to check the announcements. We have also decided to
                            include the lecturer’s contact details and feature it prominently at the top of the announcement tab as well. Students may need to email their lecturer regarding any queries that they may have and in the current user flow,
                            the lecturer’s contact details are not easily accessible and we have thus decided to shift it to a more prominent place.<br></p>

                </div>
            </div>

                        <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 0px;">Just below the module code in the header, we have also laid out some of the commonly used functions and arranged them in a horizontal manner starting with “Announcements” on the left and ending with “Multimedia” on the right. Unlike
                            the current user flow which requires users to first pull open the sidebar from the left, having these quick access layout allows users to much more easily access these commonly used functions, thereby helping to improve the
                            user flow.<br></p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 0px;">As a part of our user centered design, we have placed a files tab, forums tab, and a multimedia tab separately for quick and easy access to those pages while students are in a rush or on the move. This way, students would always
                            know where to look for these commonly used functions instead of looking through the menu.<br></p>
                    </div>

            </div>

                        <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 0px;">Apart from the forum tab, the files tab and the multimedia tab have not been redesigned. These wireframes were included to show how the “quick access links” at the top of the header would work should the user clicks on one of them.
                            As for the forum tab, we proposed to make it more accessible and efficient by creating a more interactive tab that expands once pressed. Through this design, the user could quickly read through the posts as well as reply to
                            them in one screen, rather than going through multiple sub menus and pages. Although it is something that we did not dive deep into due to the time constraint and the scope of our project being too large, we thought it would
                            align with our problem statement as it would be a more efficient for on-the-go students.<br></p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 0px;"><br>Lastly, we have also decided to redesign the sidebar to give users a better user experience when accessing the modules page. As mentioned earlier, based on the user research that we have conducted, users felt that the list
                            of tabs in the sidebar are too cluttered, disorganized and that the layout did not take into consideration the physical frame of an iPhone, causing the tab names to be placed on the far left of the screen. As a result, users
                            struggled to see the names. In the new design, we have sought to fix the visibility issue that our users have faced by ensuring that there are margins and padding in place to the left of the tab names. In addition, we have
                            also categorized the tabs by alphabetical order and split these tabs into 3 main categories (tools, general and class &amp; groups) so that users will be able to find their desired function more easily. Finally, we have also
                            removed some of the redundant functions in the sidebar such as the “SCORM” function that are not applicable to users so as to prevent the sidebar from being too cluttered, which may confuse the user.<br></p>

Based on our user research, the following functions have been placed in the bottom
                            navigation bar - Home Feed, Downloads, Time Table and Profile.<br></p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 0px;">Firstly, the home feed will include the two most important functions as gathered from our user research - Announcements and Module List, to allow for optimal accessibility. Following that, the ‘Downloads’ tab will give users a
                            one-stop-shop to download all of their files for all of their modules. Next, as requested by many users, we plan to implement the ‘Time Table’ function in the following tab which enables users to check their upcoming submission
                            deadlines and examination dates. Lastly, the ‘Profile’ tab allows users to check their account information as well as their progress for graduation which is available on the current version of LumiNUS<br></p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 0px;">With this bottom navigation bar, users will be able to reach their ideal destination on the app within one click, unlike the previous model which required multiple steps to reach a single destination. With this improvement, it
                            will offer optimal usability and efficient course of action to their most frequently used functions on the app.<br></p>

After which they can set up an alternative method of logging into the LumiNUS application. Users can choose to log
                            in using either a 4-digit passcode (shown in figure 9) or by using the built-in biometric scanner and face ID if applicable. This method of authentication will be linked to their NUS user credentials entered previously and
                            will be used to securely verify and log users in without the need for users to key in lengthy credentials.<br></p>

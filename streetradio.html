      <h4>C O N T E X T</h4>
      <p> Street Radio is a design challange that examines a user's experience of a mobile platform that interacts with a place/space by facilitating the storage and retrieval of digital information according to geo-spatial location </p>
      <p> The problem that we addressed was how listening to music has become an independent/ isolated activity that disconnects people from their surroundings and environment. Our solution to this problem was to attempt to make listening to music a more social activity that would allow people to be connected to their current surroundings by experiencing the different musical culture in different locations in real time along with other users.  </p>
      <p> Designed by Tony Kim and Jennifer Ramirez </p>

      <h4>D I S C O V E R</h4>
      <p> While brainstorming of how to incorporate geo-spatial location into an application, we thought of : </p>
      <ul>
        <li> A music streaming app that is live so that people can all listen to it at the same time (like a silent disco). </li>
        <li> An application that tells you the demographics of people in a certain area and how many mutual friends you have with the people in the area. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> We decided to design a music streaming app. </p>
      <p> For part of the research, we also read <a href="https://mappingweirdstuff.wordpress.com/2009/06/14/mapping-weird-stuff-psychogeography/">articles</a> on data visualization so that we could think about the concept of storage and retrieval of data. </p>
        <h4>D E F I N E</h4>
        <p> We thought about how isolated and disconnected everyone looked during their commute to work or school with their earphones on, so we attempted to make listening to music more social. People often associate with music as a social event, and it is. Going to concerts are very social. However, the times when we aren't at concerts dancing and singing along with strangers, we are often alone in our own space, nodding to the beat of the song no one else can hear. </p>
        <p> Our solution would be interesting because the user can get a new perspective on which part of a town listens to what type of music. Different musical experiences would be available to everyone, making listening to music a more dynamic, social experience. Our targetted users were people who commute and people who like to hike/ explore/ travel. </p>
        <p>Here are some of the questions we addressed during our brainstorming: </p>

      <h4>D E V E L O P</h4>
      <p> The low-fidelity mockups are designed so that the main feature, which is the microradio feature, is placed in the middle. The other buttoms/ tabs are placed along the bottom in order for the user to have easy access since the buttons will be near their thumbs. The maps are designed so that the areas with the "sound" territories are indicated. The larger the community/ collection of songs, the larger the radius of a certain territoy.</p>
      <p>We also wanted to incorporate a chat option in order to push for the "social" aspect. One of the main discussions we had was whether or not to allow every user to change the song in the feature of the "live readio". If one user skipped a song, that would skip the song for everyone and we were worried about people abusing that; so we thought that every user would be allowed 1 skip every hour. </p>
      <p> We also had a section where the user could save a song from the location (also indicating them where they saved it from) so that if the live radio was not appealing to them, they could also independently listen to the location's playlist.</p>
